# smortie

shitty discord.py music bot with tons of security concerns. for me and 1 friend. public because github actions

it prints your system directory out lol. super hardcoded and too many bugs.

just a fun side project. pls dont actually use it

i wont give documentation if you'd like to use it, just do the token stuff in music.py, and put your songs (.mp3, .m4a) inside playlists/(playlist name), and play by supplying a channel id.

supports playing 24/7, from a playlist, singular song, shuffling, master playlist with all songs in all playlists, and more that I don't remember.

pls dont use. and if you do, run it in github codespaces or actions. its not safe.
